  <title>Java 3D Example Programs</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This project contains the source code
for the Java&nbsp;3D example programs.
</p>
<p>Related projects include: <a href="http://j3d-core.dev.java.net/">j3d-core</a>
(the core Java&nbsp;3D API),
<a href="http://j3d-core-utils.dev.java.net/"> </a><a
 href="http://vecmath.dev.java.net/">vecmath</a>
(the 3D vector math package), and <a
 href="http://j3d-core-utils.dev.java.net/">j3d-core-utils</a>
(the Java&nbsp;3D core utilities). Refer to the <a
 href="build-instr.html">download
and build
instructions</a> for information on downloading and building vecmath.
</p>
<h3>Downloads</h3>
<p>Three types of binary builds are available in the <a
 href="http://j3d-core.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">Documents
&amp; Files</a>
section of the j3d-core project on java.net: Release (or FCS) builds;
Experimental (early access) builds; and Daily/Weekly builds. The latest
release build of Java&nbsp;3D v1.3.1 is available. A fairly stable
experimental build, labeled as Java&nbsp;3D v 1.3.2-build3 is now
available. We will set up daily or weekly builds in the near future.<br>

<h3>How to Contribute</h3>
<p>We invite developers to contribute to Java&nbsp;3D. Please refer to
the
<a href="http://java3d.dev.java.net/contribute.html">Contributing to
Java&nbsp;3D</a> section in the parent java3d project to learn
how to contribute to this project or any other Java&nbsp;3D-related
project.</p>
<h3>Feedback and Discussion<br>
</h3>
<p>We have created two Java&nbsp;3D mailing lists in the parent <a
 href="http://java3d.dev.java.net/">java3d</a> project: <a
 href="mailto:announce@java3d.dev.java.net">announce@java3d.dev.java.net</a>
and <a href="mailto:interest@java3d.dev.java.net">interest@java3d.dev.java.net</a>.
<a href="http://java3d.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">Click
here to subscribe</a> to either of these lists. The annouce list is a
low-volume moderated mailing list for announcing Java&nbsp;3D-related
news
and information. The interest list is an open mailing list for
discussing all aspects of Java&nbsp;3D, the reference implementation
for the
Java&nbsp;3D core, vecmath, utilities, example programs, etc.</p>
<p>For those who prefer a forum to a mailing list, we have created the
<a href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectForumView">Java&nbsp;3D
forum</a>, hosted as part of the JavaDesktop Community. Messages
posted on the forum are cross-posted to <a
 href="mailto:interest@java3d.dev.java.net">interest@java3d.dev.java.net</a>
and vice-versa.<br>
</p>
<p>Finally, each sub-project has its own cvs and issues mailing
lists.&nbsp;<a href="servlets/ProjectMailingListList">Click
here to
subscribe</a> to either of these lists. The <a
 href="mailto:cvs@j3d-examples.dev.java.net">cvs@j3d-examples.dev.java.net</a>
list is for automated CVS change messages and discussion of those
changes. The <a href="mailto:issues@j3d-examples.dev.java.net">issues@j3d-examples.dev.java.net</a>
list is for automated issue tracking.</p>
