<p>This project contains the source code
for the Java&nbsp;3D<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> example
programs.
</p>
<p>Related projects include: <a href="https://j3d-core.dev.java.net/">j3d-core</a>
(the core Java&nbsp;3D API),
<a href="https://j3d-core-utils.dev.java.net/"> </a><a
 href="https://vecmath.dev.java.net/">vecmath</a>
(the 3D vector math package), and <a
 href="https://j3d-core-utils.dev.java.net/">j3d-core-utils</a>
(the Java&nbsp;3D core utilities). Refer to the <a
 href="build-instr.html">download
and build
instructions</a> for information on downloading and building vecmath.

<h3><a name="Downloads"></a>Downloads</h3>
<p>Three types of binary builds are available in the <a
 href="https://j3d-core.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">Documents
&amp; Files</a>
section of the j3d-core project on java.net: Release (or FCS) builds;
Experimental (early access) builds; and Daily/Weekly builds. The latest
release build of Java&nbsp;3D v1.3.1 is available. A fairly stable
experimental build, labeled as Java&nbsp;3D v 1.3.2-build4 is now
available. We will set up daily or weekly builds in the near future.<br>

<h3><a name="How_to_Contribute"></a>How to Contribute</h3>
<p>We invite developers to contribute to Java&nbsp;3D. Please refer to
the
<a href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/contribute.html">Contributing to
Java&nbsp;3D</a> page in the parent java3d project to learn
how to contribute to this project or any other Java&nbsp;3D-related
project. See the <a href="https://javadesktop.dev.java.net/govern.html">JavaDesktop
Community Governance Guidelines</a> for general guidelines on
participating in JavaDesktop community projects, such as j3d-examples.
</p>
<h3><a name="Reporting_Issues"></a>Reporting Issues<br>
</h3>
<p>We have set up the <a
 href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issue Tracker</a>
in the parent java3d
project
to track issues (bugs, feature requests, etc.) for
Java&nbsp;3D-related
sub-projects. Please use the above link rather than the Issue Tracker
in this j3d-examples project. Refer to the <a
 href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/#Reporting_Issues">Reporting
Issues</a> section in the parent java3d project for more information.
</p>
<h3><a name="Feedback_and_Discussion"></a>Feedback and Discussion<br>
</h3>
<p>We have created four Java&nbsp;3D mailing lists in the parent <a
 href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/">java3d</a> project:&nbsp;<span
 style="color: blue;">interest 'at' java3d.dev.java.net</span>,
<span style="color: blue;">announce 'at' java3d.dev.java.net</span>,
<span style="color: blue;">issues 'at' java3d.dev.java.net</span>,
and <span style="color: blue;">cvs 'at' java3d.dev.java.net</span>
(replace 'at' with @).
<a href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">Click
here to subscribe</a> to any of these lists. The <span
 style="font-style: italic;">interest</span> list is an open mailing
list for
discussing all aspects of Java&nbsp;3D, the reference implementation
for the
Java&nbsp;3D core, vecmath, utilities, example programs, etc. The <span
 style="font-style: italic;">annouce</span> list is a
low-volume moderated mailing list for announcing Java&nbsp;3D-related
news
and information. The <span style="font-style: italic;">issues</span>
list is for automated issues tracking, and the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">cvs</span> list is for automated CVS
change messages (for changes to the parent java3d web pages only).</p>
<p>For those who prefer a forum to a discussion mailing list, we have
created the
<a href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectForumView"
 target="_blank">Java&nbsp;3D
forum</a>, hosted as part of the JavaDesktop Community. Messages
posted on the forum are cross-posted to <span style="color: blue;">interest
'at' java3d.dev.java.net</span>
and vice-versa.<br>
</p>
<p>Finally, each sub-project has its own cvs mailing
list.&nbsp;<a href="servlets/ProjectMailingListList">Click here to
subscribe</a> to this list. The <span style="color: blue;">cvs 'at'
j3d-examples.dev.java.net</span>
list is for automated CVS change messages and discussion of those
changes.<br>
