<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Building
the Java 3D examples&nbsp; programs<br>
<br>
</span>To build the Java 3D examples programs, you must first download
the j3d-examples
CVS repository:<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><br>
<br>
System Requirements<br>
<br>
</span>Any operating environment that supports J2SE and Java 3D should
work.We have built j3d-examples on the following operating environments:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Solaris: Sparc (Ultra60 or better) running Solaris 9</li>
  <li>Linux: i386/i586 running SuSE 9 or RedHat 9.0</li>
  <li>Windows: Windows/XP (Windows
2000 should work, but is untested)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
The following software must be installed:<br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se">JDK 1.4.2&nbsp;</a> <br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant">Apache Ant 1.6.1&nbsp;</a>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/">Java 3D
1.3.1</a> or later.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Building
j3d-examples<br>
<br>
</span> Before you start building, please check that your PATH must
include the
following directories:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ant-root-dir&gt;/bin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;jdk-root_dir&gt;/bin<br>
<br>
NOTE that Java 3D must be installed into the JDK that you have in your
path <span style="font-weight: bold;">OR</span> you must put the Java
3D &amp; vecmath jar files in your CLASSPATH and the Java 3D libraries
in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.<br>
<br>
To build all examples:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd &lt;java3d-root&gt;/j3d-examples<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ant<br>
<br>
This will build all example programs, each one being placed in the
corresponding src/&lt;ExampleProgram&gt; directory.&nbsp; You may run
ant from a subdirectory in order to just build that program. For
example, to<br>
build the HelloUniverse program:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd &lt;java3d-root&gt;/j3d-examples/src/HelloUniverse<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ant<br>
<br>
